The following describes how to use custom patterns in the XToLevel LDB text output.
Custom patterns should be entered into the text box in the config window, after selecting "custom" from the dropdown.

Note! Storing your patters in a safe place outside the game is a good idea. 
      Patterns *might* be lost during patches and addon updates.

There are two methods to create patters:
1: The simplyfied <tag> version, specially created to make simple patters easy to create.
2: The custom {tag} version, used internally by the application. A bit more complex, but a lot more flexible.

---------------------------
-- 1. The simple version --
---------------------------
This is a simplified version, which is good for creating simple patterns.

Availble tags:
* <kills> - The amount of kills a player needs to level.
* <quests> - The amount of quests a player needs to level.
* <bgs> - The amount of battlegrounds a player needs to level.
* <bgo> - The amount of battleground objectives a player needs to level.
* <xp> - The percentage or the number of bars of XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* <xpnum> - The XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* <rested> - The EXTRA experience you will collect for mob kills.
* <restedp> - The percentage of your current level the rested bonus covers. (150% or 30 bars is the ceiling)
* <pet> - The amount of kills a hunter pet needs to level.
* <petxp> - The percentage or the number of bars of your pet's XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* <petxpnum> - Your pet's XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* <timer> - The estimated time remaining until you reach your next level, based on your current XP per hour.

(Note, that the <xp> and <petxp> values inlucde the % char at the end.)

Each of those tags *can be* defined with a number of attributes:
* label - A string to be added in front of the tag's value.
* seperator - A character that is to be used as a seperater between tags, if needed.
* post - A character to be added to the value. (Will be colored by XP progress if enabled.)

(Note, that none of them are required. You can leave out all of them if you want.)

Examples:
- <kills label="" post="K"><quests label="" post="Q" seperator=" ">
 Output: 100K 20Q
 
- <pet label="Pet Kills" post="-"> [<petxp label="" post="-">]
 Output: Pet Kills: 100- [25%-]
 
- <xpnum label="XP"> [<xp>] <rested label="R"> [<restedp>] <petxpnum label="Pet"> [<petxp>]
 Output: XP: 1,234 [23.4%] R: 3.210 [145%] Pet: 341 [30.4%]

 
-----------------------------
-- 2. The complete version --
-----------------------------

The patterns use a very basic HTML-like syntax, using {} rather than <>.
For example:
 - K: {kills} Q: {quests} XP: {xp}
 
Note that it is *possible* to nest certain tags within each other (see the "countdown" pattern for example), but this is highly unpredictable,
and this was never, and is not now, a planned feature. Experiment if you want, but I will not consider weird behavior in nested tags as bugs.
Disabling the parent tag in the in-game configuration will also disable any nested tags.

Available tags are:
* {kills} - The amount of kills a player needs to level.
* {quests} - The amount of quests a player needs to level.
* {bgs} - The amount of battlegrounds a player needs to level.
* {bgo} - The amount of battleground objectives a player needs to level.
* {xp} - The percentage or the number of bars of XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* {xpnum} The XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* {pet} - The amount of kills a hunter pet needs to level.
* {petxp} - The percentage or the number of bars of your pet's XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* {petxpnum} - Your pet's XP gained or remaining for the current level.
* {timer} - The estimated time remaining until you reach your next level, based on your current XP per hour.

Inside each of these tags, you can use the following values:
* {$label} - Will be replaced by a locale specific label defined in the locale files.
* {$value} - Will be replaced by the tag's value.
* {$seperator:*} - Will be used to seperate tags when needed. The * char should be replaced with whatever char you want.

Additionally, you can use the following tags to color the output:
* {color=RRGGBB} - The RGB color will be applied to all enclosed text.
				   NOTE! Nesting these tags will not work!
* {progress} - Applies the color representing the XP progress to the enclosed text.
			   Only usable inside one of the tags mentioned above.!
			   
Example:
 - {kills}{seperator: }{color=FF0000}{$label}:{/color} {progress}{$value}{/progress}{/kills}
 
These are the built in patterns.
